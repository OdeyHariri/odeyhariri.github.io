									<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
									<p>I love creating things so take a look at the projects I worked on in the past and/or in the present. Here I post images/videos and explanations of things that I created using 3D printing, arduino, motors, etc.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Lock Combo Opener</h3>
											<p>This project is a 3D printed chassis with a stepper motor and servo that spins the combination lock and unlocks it. The motors are controlled by an Arduino with a breadboard as well as a 12 V battery. The code allows the user to input the combo of the lock and then it spins the motor to the percise position (with the use of a encoder) to unlock the lock and then the servo lifts up on the shackle. I learned a lot about the iterative design process because I ended up 3D printing more than 10 parts to try to get the pieces to align. I also learned a lot about programming with an Arduino and this is where I learned C++ online to help me. Here is the <a href= "https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/ohariri_purdue_edu/EXekQZ-T-QRKlCfWJTpRPm4B3SwWQTAUV_UZVoT3zn4rHg?e=EFHj4s">Link</a> to the video of the prototype working. (I CADED all the parts using Autodesk Inventor) - 2020:2021</p>

											<h3 class="major">Extandable and Retractable Lightsaber</h3>
											<p>This project is currently being worked on. I have completely CADed the assembly of the parts and I am working on 3D printing all the parts. This lightsaber uses a DC motor to extend and retract very quickly, unlike any other spring lightsaber. The motor will spin a tape measure roll that will extend the blade up very quickly and then retract it very quickly. Here is a <a href= "https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/ohariri_purdue_edu/EcvQKekSgr1MllKEYqfGzEcB95x5CcntJmSvTGHuU1YYTQ?e=7FTa8e">Link</a> to a video of the Prototype. In this video I am using a Polarity Switch to turn the spur gears that will be used to turn the tape measure roll, the switch is used to change the direction of rotation to retract and extend the blade. In this prototype there are bearings, axles, motors, 3D printed gears and chassis. I have been working a lot on the project to get it work, but it will need to take some more iterations. This prototype looks different from the CAD images because I currently don't have access to the CAD files. For this project I used my own 3D printer and had to learn how to optimize it to make this prototype work. - 2021</p>

											<h3 class="major">Remote Controlled Sailboat</h3>
											<p>This project has just been designed and will be hopefully created in the future. This CAD shows a Laser sailboat that has two powerful stepper motors that will control both the rudder (steering) and the sail (force) by using ropes and pulleys. This project idea was mainly for the purpose of allowing me to practice my CAD skills, specifically assemblies and creating real world objects. I also to began posting my CAD design on GrabCad to help other people use the parts I made (I posted the pulley's and the sailboat specifically). (I CADDED almost all these parts in Inventor) - 2021</p>

											<h3 class="major">Mechanically Powered Skateboard</h3>
											<p>This project has only been designed and will probably stay just as an idea. I have only created a CAD assembly of the skateboard and the idea is that there is a piston that your foot pushes down on and it rotates the back axel of the skateboard to apply motion. This project idea was mainly to help me practice my assembly skills in CAD. (I CADDED almost all the parts in Inventor) - 2020</p>
